:maple_leaf: **The evolution of blogging**  

:leaves: 2019.11：Start a CSDN blog and try blogging  

:leaves: 2020.10：Since CSDN can not customize the theme, start trying the blog garden

:leaves: 2021.06：The blog Garden's built-in article module was so bad that I decided to use Typecho system

:leaves: 2021.11：Want to make a theme, but pit too much, ditch Typecho and move on to the Halo blog

:leaves: 2022.10：The server is about to expire and I don't want to renew it，try building Hugo's static blog using Github+Cloudflare-page's approach
